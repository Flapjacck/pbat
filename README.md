# PBAT

## Overview

PBAT is a machine learning application that calculates the probability of one Pokemon defeating another in battle. The system analyzes Pokemon statistics, type effectiveness, movesets, and abilities to generate accurate win/loss predictions using neural networks.

## Future Features

- Real-time Pokemon data retrieval from PokeAPI
- Machine learning-based battle outcome prediction
- Type effectiveness and stat-based calculations
- Comprehensive move damage analysis
- Battle simulation capabilities

## Stack

- **Python** - Core programming language
- **TensorFlow** - Machine learning framework for neural network implementation
- **PokeAPI** - Free Pokemon data API for comprehensive Pokemon information
- **NumPy** - Numerical computing for statistical calculations
- **Pandas** - Data manipulation and analysis
- **Requests** - HTTP library for API interactions

## API Reference

This project utilizes the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) for all Pokemon-related data including stats, types, moves, and abilities.
